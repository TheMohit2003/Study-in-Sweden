# Renders different word

This is a sample [webpage](https://themohit2003.github.io/Study-in-Sweden/) that 
renders a new word every 1.5 seconds . While web surfing I landed straight into
swedish government's [Study in Sweden](https://studyinsweden.se/) website . I tried to
replicate the word changer feature on [swedish](https://studyinsweden.se/) website.
